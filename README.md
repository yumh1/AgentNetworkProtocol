## Vision and Positioning

Agent Network Protocol (ANP) is an open-source communication protocol for intelligent agents.

Agent Network Protocol (ANP) aims to become **the HTTP of the Agentic Web era**.

Our vision is to **define how agents connect with each other, building an open, secure, and efficient collaboration network for billions of agents**.

</p>

We believe that the agent internet represents the next generation of information infrastructure succeeding the human-centric internet, which will fundamentally transform how the digital world connects and collaborates. In this vision:

- **From Platform-Centric to Protocol-Centric**: The current internet ecosystem is built around platforms, where data and services are locked in "digital silos." The agent internet will reshape this imbalance, returning the internet from a closed, fragmented state to its open, freely connected origins.

- **Connection is Power**: In a truly open, interconnected network, free interaction between nodes maximizes innovation potential and creates tremendous value. In the future, each agent will be both an information consumer and a service provider, with every node able to discover, connect, and interact with any other node in the network without barriers.

- **AI-Native Network**: Unlike webpages and interfaces designed for humans, the agent internet will build an AI-friendly native data network where all nodes are describable, discoverable, and callable agents or data units, and every link is a semantically clear, structurally unified protocol connection.

This vision requires a foundational protocol similar to what HTTP is for the human internet—this is precisely why ANP was created.

**Note**: This project has not issued any digital currency on any platform or blockchain.

## Why We Need ANP

While current internet infrastructure is quite comprehensive, there remains a lack of optimal communication and connection solutions for the specific needs of agent networks. We are committed to addressing three major challenges facing agent networks:

- 🌐 **Interconnection**: Enabling all agents to communicate with each other, breaking down data silos, and allowing AI to access complete contextual information.
- 🖥️ **Native Interfaces**: AI should not need to mimic human internet browsing; instead, AI should interact with the digital world using its most proficient methods (APIs or communication protocols).
- 🤝 **Efficient Collaboration**: Using AI, agents can self-organize and self-negotiate to build a more cost-effective and efficient collaboration network than the existing internet.

## Three-Layer Protocol Architecture

  <img src="/images/anp-architecture.png" width="50%" alt="Protocol Layer Diagram"/>
</p>

- 🔒 **Identity and Secure Communication Layer**: Based on the W3C DID (Decentralized Identifiers) specification, this layer leverages existing mature web infrastructure to create a decentralized identity authentication scheme and an end-to-end encrypted communication solution. It allows agents from any platform to authenticate each other without relying on any centralized system.
- 🌍 **Meta-Protocol Layer**: A protocol for negotiating communication protocols between agents. It is key to evolving the agent network into a self-organizing, self-negotiating, efficient collaboration network.
- 📡 **Application Protocol Layer**: Based on semantic web specifications, enabling agents to describe their capabilities and supported application protocols, and efficiently manage these protocols.

## Quick Start

If you want to quickly understand the basic concepts and usage of ANP, you can check our getting started guide: [ANP Getting Started Guide](docs/chinese/ANP入门指南.md)

If you want to quickly run ANP-related demos, you can check our sample program documentation: [ANP Sample Programs](docs/chinese/ANP示例程序.md)

## Protocol SDK

We are developing an open-source implementation of AgentNetworkProtocol, and its repository can be found at: [https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentConnect](https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentConnect)

## Further Reading

- Complete materials are available at [Extended Reading](docs/links.md)
- For detailed design, please read the [ANP Technical White Paper](/01-agentnetworkprotocol-technical-white-paper.md)
- Refer to the open-source implementation [AgentConnect Examples](https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentConnect)

## Milestones

For both the protocol and open-source code implementation, we are gradually advancing in the following order:

- [x] Build identity authentication and end-to-end encrypted communication protocol and implementation. This is the foundation and core of our entire project, with protocol design and foundational code are substantially complete.
- [x] Meta-protocol design and meta-protocol code implementation. Current protocol design and code development are substantially complete.
- [x] Application layer protocol design and development.
  - [x] Support for agent description.
  - [x] Support for agent discovery.
  - [ ] Application protocol design for specific domains.
