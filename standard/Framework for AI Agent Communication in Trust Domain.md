## 2. Overview of the operation
### 2.1. Roles
The Agent communication protocol defines three roles:
- AI Agent
An automated intelligent entity that achieves a specific goal (autonomously or not) on behalf of another entity, by e.g. interacting with its environment, acquiring contextual information, reasoning, self-learning, decision-making, and executing tasks (independently or in collaboration with other AI Agents).
- Agent Registration Server
The server enables Agents to register their capabilities, and discover each other’s capabilities based on intent，task or other information.
- Agent Communication Server
The server enables Agents to communicate and collaborate with each other, which provides session management and routing function.
### 2.2. Protocol Flow  

![Protocol Flow](./pic/pic.jpg)

Figure 1: Abstract Protocol Flow   

The abstract flow illustrated in Figure 1 describes the interaction between the three roles and includes the following steps:
(A)  The AI Agent B requests to register its capabilities and related attributes to Agent Registration Server.
(B)  The Agent Registration Server authenticates the AI Agent B’s capabilities and then stores them, e.g., in its local database.
(C)  AI Agent A initiates a capability discover request to the Agent Registration Server, the request includes the intent, task or other information.
(D)  The Agent Registration Server matches the intent or task with the capabilities stored in its local database, and responses with matched AI Agents list to the AI Agent A.
Option1:
(E)  The AI Agent A selects AI Agent B from the list and sends a communication request to AI Agent B via Agent Communication Server.
(F)  The Agent Communication Server establishes the session and routes the message to AI Agent B.
(G)  The AI Agent B receives the communication request and sends a response to the Agent Communication Server.
(H)  The Agent Communication Server transfers the response to the AI Agent A.
Option2:
(E’) The AI Agent A selects AI Agent B from the list and sends a communication request to AI Agent B directly.
(F’) The AI Agent B receives the communication request and sends a response to the AI Agent A.

## 3. Digital ID
The digital identity mechanism is used for the registration, discovery and communication flows.
- Registration: digital identity contains a global unique identifier of AI agent as a basis for authentication and addressing during communication flow. Several agent-related attributes (capabilities/skills/services) are contained in the digital identity and registered with the identifier at the same time. The related credentials in the digital identity can be used for the verification.
- Discovery: the registered AI agent can then be discovered by other agents based on either identifier or capabilities. The agent can be discovered across different domains.
- Communication: one AI agent can communicate with the other AI agent, by sending an initial message with the identifier obtained from the discovered digital identity. The network can use this identifier for addressing and routing the message to the target AI agent. 
- Authentication: during the communication establishment, both AI agents can use the credentials for the identifier for authentication. Attributes can be negotiated after the authentication.
- Authorization: compared to human communication, AI agent communication needs to be explicitly authorized at all time. The attribute-based authorization mechanism can support both direct agent-agent authorization and delegated authorization, even for the user authorization.
In order to fulfill the requirements mentioned above, we suggest to introduce the W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) standards as the basic digital identity components.
- DID: The core DID specification does not require implementers to use specific computational infrastructure to build decentralized identifiers, allowing us to fully leverage existing mature technologies and well-established network infrastructure to build DIDs.
- VC: The VC can be used as container of attributes of an AI agent. The attributes of an AI agent may come from different sources which can be verified by the VC. This will help increase the interoperability of cross-domain communications.

## 4. Agent Description——ANP撰写
Agent Description (AD) exists in document form. The AD document serves as the entry point to access an agent, functioning similarly to a website homepage. Other agents can obtain information such as the agent's name, affiliated entity, functionalities, products, services, and interaction APIs or protocols from this AD document. With this information, data communication and collaboration between agents can be achieved.
### 4.1. Agent Description Document Format
The Agent Description (AD) document serves as the external entry point for an agent and can be provided in either of the following formats:
#### 4.1.1. Natural Language Format
Leveraging advancements in AI capabilities, the AD document can be entirely described using natural language.
#### 4.1.2. Structured Format（recommended）
Since different agents may utilize varying models with distinct capabilities, a structured approach is recommended for ensuring consistent and accurate interpretation of the same data across diverse models.
Structured Format supports multiple document types:
- JSON (Recommended)
- JSON-RPC
- Other structured document formats
### 4.2. Agent Information Interaction Mechanism
The system employs an information interaction mechanism analogous to "web crawlers." Specifically, agents utilize URLs to interconnect externally provided resources (e.g., information, interfaces) through agent description documents, forming a networked ecosystem. Other agents can then operate like crawlers, selectively retrieving appropriate resources to local systems based on the described metadata, where subsequent decision-making and processing occur autonomously.
Advantages of the Web-Crawler-like Information Interaction Mode：
- Compatibility with Existing Internet Architecture: Facilitates search engine indexing of agent-publicized information, enabling the creation of an efficient agent data network.
- Enhanced Privacy Protection: Pulling remote data to local systems for contextual processing mitigates user privacy leakage risks inherent in task-delegation models.
- Inherent Hierarchical Structure: Supports scalable interactions among a large number of agents.
Agent description documents include the following two types of resources:
#### 4.2.1. Informatica
Agents may provide the following types of data：
- Textual files (e.g.： .txt, .csv, .json)
- Image files (e.g.： .jpg, .png, .svg)
- Video files (e.g.： .mp4, .mov, .webm)
- Audio files (e.g.： .mp3, .wav, .aac)
- Other files
#### 4.2.2. Interface
Agent interfaces are categorized into two types:
- Natural Language Interface
-- Enables agents to deliver personalized services through natural language interaction.
-- Supports human-like communication and adaptive responses.
- Structured Interface
-- Facilitates efficient and standardized service delivery via predefined protocols.
-- Ensures interoperability and machine-to-machine automation.
### 4.3. Security Mechanism
Security configuration in Agent Description (AD) documents is mandatory. The security definition must be activated through the security member at the agent level. This configuration constitutes the required security mechanism for agent interactions.
- Global Scope: When security is declared at the root level of an AD document, all resources within the document must enforce this security mechanism for access.
- Resource-Specific Scope: If security is defined within an individual resource, access to that resource is granted only when the specified security conditions are met.
- Precedence Rule: In cases where resource-level security conflicts with root-level security, the resource-level definition takes precedence.
### 4.4. Integrity Verification
To prevent malicious tampering, impersonation, or reuse of Agent Description (AD) documents, a verification mechanism Proof is incorporated into the AD document structure. 
The definition of Proof shall comply with the specification: [https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#defn-domain].

能力注册流程和关键消息、参数
The registration procedure for an AI Agent in trust domain can refer to steps (A)-(B) in Figure 1. In trust domain scenario, the AI Agents need to register their attributes to a centralized Agent Registration Server, which can be an Agent, a network function, a third-party server, etc. For example, in 6G core network, the Agent Registration Server can evolve and enhance based on the Network Repository Function (NRF), supporting the registration of the traditional network functions and the network Agents. 
The parameters that an Agent needs to register in a trust domain (step A) may include:
- Name: The name of the Agent, which may not be unique and typically represented as a string.
- ID: The global unique ID of the Agent configured by the network operator.
- Description: Unlike the AD in section 4, the description in the Agent Register information should provide a more concise summary of the Agent’s relevant details based on natural language, typically serving as an abstract of the AD.
- Address: The access address of the Agent, which might be an URL, FQDN, ICN address, etc.
- Version: The current version of the Agent, which can be updated in real-time.
- Capabilities: The capabilities supported by the Agent, including the communication capabilities, interaction modes and multimodal capabilities, etc. The communication capabilities refer to the communication protocols supported by the Agent, such as http/2, http/3, A2A, ANP, MCP, etc. The interaction modes may include request-response and subscription-notification and others. The multimodal capabilities refer to the data modalities that the agent can process, such as text, images, video, etc.
- Services: The services that the agent can provide. For example, in 6G core network the services may include communication service, AI service, sensing service, computing service, data service, etc. A network Agent may support one or more of these network services.
- Skills: A list of detailed description of the skills supported by the Agent. The content of each skill include the name, ID, corresponding services, brief abstract, required input, etc. For example, an Agent deployed in 6G core network support skills named “Policy Control” and “User Location Prediction”. Among these, “Policy Control” corresponds to communication service and requires inputs including user policy-related information; “User Location Prediction” corresponds to AI service and requires inputs including user identification and historical location information.
- Interfaces: The network interfaces that the agent can provide.
- Security related information: For example, the licenses, authentication credentials, keys of the Agent.
Then the Agent Registration Server locally sores the registration information of the Agent. Upon successful registration, the Agent Registration Server returns a registration response to the Agent (step B).
